ThisHISTORY  file was created 5 from raw exposures from CV3 data. The data were not HISTORY IPC corrected but DQ intialized, saturation corrected, bias subtracted aHISTORY nd then reference pixel corrected. Then sigma_clipped (3-sigma, 3-iteratHISTORY ions) about the mean and then combined using the mean. Error and DQ arraHISTORY ys were then populated. This file was created from the python scripts brHISTORY eaking_nints_nis_darks.py, convert_niriss_dark.py, cal_pipe_dark_strt.pyHISTORY , ref_dark.py, cal_pipe_dark_fnh.py, and fnl_steps_ref_dark.py and "raw"HISTORY  long darks (~1000 sec, by definition). Documentation describing the strHISTORY ategy and algorithms is found in "Description of the NIRISS Bias and DarHISTORY k Reference Files" and can be found at: /grp/jwst/wit/niriss/CDP-2/referHISTORY ence_files/documentation.  Python scripts can be found at /grp/jwst/wit/HISTORY niriss/CDP-2/scripts and there is no version number for the scripts. TheHISTORY  DQ flags 2(Hot), 4(Warm), 8(Unrealiable Dark), and 16(Unreliable Slope)HISTORY  can be found in the Bad Pixel Mask.
